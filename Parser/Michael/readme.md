10/23
I've started working on the parser, part one is a bit of a doozy, I tried looking at Maria's code for the .y file and <br>
I tried to write my own code in my .y file<br>
I was going to wait after thursday so the TA would shed some insight but I got worried so I started now.<br>

The code is a work in progress and I'll be honest I have no idea what I am doing, I'll try my best but I don't expect too<br>
great of code from me.

I managed to fit in most of the pl0 grammar the professor provided, but hit a wall so I stopped, I won't be working on it<br>
until after thursday cause I am really busy, but next week I promise I'll be working specifically on it.<br>

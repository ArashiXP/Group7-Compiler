I started trying to implement stuff, but got lost since his helper stuff is useless and so is the float stuff<br>

Pulling my code isn't going to do much but I did set up all the starter files we needed

11/27
I managed to get one more test case working so we are at 12/39 which makes 27 fails and with -3 for each failed test that gives<br>
us<br> 

160-81 = 79<br>
adding the 20 points from no errors on eustis we have 99<br>
and adding the 20 points for readability we get 119 / 200<br>

if the rubric is wrong then if we ammount each test is worth 3 points we well end up with a 76/200 which will still give us an<br>
an overall good project grade

I don't really know what i'm doing and covid isn't helping so i am sorry

I did some playing around and managed to get<br>
make to work, I have a meh understanding of <br>
how flex works but all we have to do is play <br>
with the lexer_main.c

Though I could be entirely wrong, since I'm more <br>
focused on our midterm and some other exams I have <br>
next week sooo

If you can figure anything out please make a readme<br>
or a note or anything and just post it to discord or<br>
whatever
